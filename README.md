# Personal Blog CMS
A repository wherein I host static .md files for my own personal blog.

### Why GitHub?
I want to create my own blogging site ASAP, so, I will temporarily use github as my site's CMS
in order to push forward with my ideas. 

Originally, I deployed my CMS using heroku, but with their recent [announcement](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter), I am now unable to host my other CMS
that uses strapi.

### Self-Made CMS?
Yes. In the future, I plan on making my own CMS using supabase. For now, I will stick on using this cms temporarily until I have plotted my attack points for making my own CMS.
